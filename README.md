Color Switcher Project - README.md

This project is a simple JavaScript application that allows users to change the background color of a webpage by clicking on colored buttons.

Features
Change background color to four different options: red,blue,yellow and green.
Uses event listeners for user interaction.
Getting Started
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Amlendu1611/ColorSwitcher.git
Open the HTML file:
Open the index.html file in your web browser.

How it Works
The code utilizes JavaScript to achieve the color-changing functionality. Here's a breakdown:

Selecting Buttons:
The code uses document.querySelectorAll to select all elements with the class button. This creates a list of all the buttons on the page.
Selecting Body:
document.querySelector('body') selects the body element of the webpage.

Adding Click Event Listeners:
A forEach loop iterates through each button. Inside the loop, an event listener is added to each button using addEventListener. 
This listener listens for the click event on the button.

Changing Background Color:
When a button is clicked, the click event listener function is triggered. This function checks the id of the clicked button (e.target.id).
If the id matches any of the color options (grey, white, blue, yellow), the body.style.backgroundColor property is set to that color, effectively changing the background.

Additional Notes
This is a basic example. You can easily extend this code to include more color options and functionalities.
The code currently uses color names directly. Consider using hex codes or RGB values for better control over colors.

Feel free to contribute to this project by adding:
More color options
Different ways to choose colors (e.g., dropdown menu)
Improved user interface for buttons
I hope this README provides a clear understanding of the Color Switcher project.
